# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

Here is some information about tasks that members can work on.

Currently, tasks are being set on our Jira. You can view and assign yourself tasks there.

If you are unfamiliar with any of the terminology or concepts described in any task but are interested, first attempt to look up what they mean or how they work yourself. If that does not work, feel free to ask anyone in the club that should know, we are all open to helping.

If your task involves finding/buying parts to use, that is intentional, you must find the parts that you need. Ask us for things to buy or things that we might have for you to use, however, you must give us the intention for the parts/materials and how exactly you plan to use them. This is not to prevent you from experimenting but to ensure our limited budget is used effectively.

You are expected to go beyond what the task goals state, meaning, things like prototyping on a breadboard and, for some of these tasks, even designing a PCB are implied. Again, feel free to ask members for help or for parts that you need.

When working on electrical tasks, always keep the rules in mind. If you are uncertain about which set of rules to reference, please ask someone who should know. Additionally, keep voltage and current in mind when working with physical parts, not everything you will work with is directly tolerant with each other, i.e. 3.3v vs 5v ICs.

Note: All the "Goals" sections in Jira are listed in order of importance
